Introduction This is my first semester project, developed in C++ as part
of my coursework. The project simulates a simple Cricket Game, providing
a fun way to learn and implement basic programming concepts.

Features Player selection Scoring system Simple cricket match simulation
Basic game rules Technologies Used C++: The entire project is written in
C++ using core concepts like: Loops Functions Conditional Statements
Arrays How to Run Clone this repository: bash Copy code git clone
https://github.com/your-username/cricket-game.git Open the project in
your favorite C++ IDE or text editor. Compile the project using any C++
compiler (e.g., g++). bash Copy code g++ cricket_game.cpp -o
